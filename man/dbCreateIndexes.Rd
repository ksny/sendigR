\title{Create indexes in SEND database}
\usage{
dbCreateIndexes(dbToken, replaceExisting = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dbToken}{Mandatory\cr
Token for the open database connection}

\item{replaceExisting}{Optional\cr
Whether an already existing set of indexes in the database may be replaced
by a new set of indexes.}
}
\description{
Create a set of indexes on the tables in an SQLite SEND database to
optimize performance of extraction of data from the different functions in
the package.\cr
All the indexes are named \code{<domain name>_sendigr_<nn>} - .e.g.
\code{TS_sendigr_01}.\cr If any additional indexes are manually created in
the database, avoid to include 'sendigr' in the name, because all existing
indexes with that included in the name will be initially deleted when
execution the function with \code{replaceExisting = TRUE}.\cr
It's recommended to wait with the creation of the indexes until the major
amount of studies to be loaded in to the database are loaded.
